        A stack is a linear data structure which stores its elements in particular order. This order followed by a stack is known as LIFO (Last In First Out).<br><br>

        A example of real life phenomena of stacks is of plates stacked over one another on a table.<br><br>

        The plate which is at the top is the first one to be removed, it is not possible to remove the last plate unless the above plates have been removed, following the principle Last In First Out.

        The depth-first search algorithm progresses by expanding the starting node and then going deeper until the goal node is found, or until a node that has no children is encountered. When a dead-end is reached, the algorithm backtracks, returning to the most recent node that has not been completely explored.<br><br>

        It uses a stack as an auxiliary data structure.

    <string name="topo_txt"><![CDATA[
        A topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge uv from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering.<br><br>

        The vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another. In this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks.<br><br>

        A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

        An alternative approach for topological sorting is based on depth-first search.<br><br>

        A Hash table is a data structure in which keys are mapped to array positions by a hash function. <br><br>

        A value stored in a hash table can then be searched in O(1) time, by using the same hash function which generates an address from the key.<br><br>

        The process of mapping the keys to appropriate locations (or indices) in a hash table is called hashing.<br>

        The main advantage of hash tables over other data structures is speed. The access time of an element is on average O(1), therefore lookup could be performed very fast. Hash tables are particularly efficient when the maximum number of entries can be predicted in advance.

        A hash function is a mathematical formula which, when applied to a key, produces an value which can be used as an index for the key in the hash table. The main aim of a hash function is that elements should be uniformly distributed.<br><br>

        It produces a unique set of integers within some suitable range in order to reduce the number of collisions.

    <string name="bh_txt"><![CDATA[
        One implementation for closed hashing groups hash table slots into buckets.<br><br>

        The M slots of the hash table are divided into B buckets, with each bucket consisting of M/B slots. <br><br>

        The hash function then assigns each record to the first slot within one of the buckets. <br><br>

        If this slot is already occupied, then the bucket slots are searched sequentially until an open slot is found. <br><br>

        If a bucket is entirely full, then the record is stored in an overflow bucket of infinite capacity at the end of the table. All buckets share the same overflow bucket.<br><br>

        An efficient implementation will use a hash function that distributes the records evenly among the buckets so that as few records as possible go into the overflow bucket.<br><br>
